#### Calculations ####

#### Control Systems (Linkages, Actuators, Wires,)
# Flight controls weight equation
Wfc = Kfc * W0**(2/3) * 1.2

# Engine controls weight equation
WeCon = 5.0 * N + 0.80 * Lec


#### Instruments and Avionics
# Instruments weight equation
Winst = 4.509 * Kp * Ktp * Nc**0.541 * Nc * (lf + Bw)**0.5

#Avionics weight equation
Wavio = 1.73 * Wuav**0.983


#### Fuel and Oil System (Tubes, Fuel Tank)
# Fuel system weight equation
Wfs = 2.405 * Vt**0.606 * (1 + Vi/Vt)**-1.0 * (1 + Vp/Vt) * Nt**0.5


#### Other (Hydraulic, Pneumatic, Electrical Systems)
# Hydraulics weight equation
Whyd = 0.2673 * Nf * (lf + Bw)**0.937

# De-Icing
WdIce =0.002* Wdg

# Electrical System 
Wele = 7.291 * Rkva**0.782 * La**0.346 * Ngen**0.10
